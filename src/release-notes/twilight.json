  "extra": "A nice update that brings some cool new features and fixes!\n\nWe are also excited to announce that we moved into <a href=\"https://floss.social/@zenbrowser\">floss.social</a>!\n\nIn response to recent privacy concerns, we've significantly strengthened Zen's privacy measures. Previously, we only disabled telemetry, but some minimal pings were still being sent. Now, Firefox telemetry has been completely stripped out from the core.\n\nAdditionally, onboarding pages and initial essentials favicons are now locally bundled and our website no longer relies on any external services/CDNs and/or cloudflare services. Initial essentials selected on startup will only be loaded once clicked on the tab as well, meaning connections wont be done until you explicitly enter the tab. We also changed our initial essentials variations to more private/productivity focused sites.\n\nOnly essential security updates and other non-telemetry-related services remain. As a result, the number of external connections has dropped from 82 to around 20-10 â€” factoring in that Zen's site is loaded twice (for the welcome page and privacy policy).\n\nThis will take effect since <a href=\"https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/actions/runs/14738545382\">this build</a>. Please let us know if you experience any issues!\n\nPsst. With the release of Firefox 138, folders are just around the corner!",
